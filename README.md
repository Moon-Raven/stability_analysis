# Stability analysis of dynamical systems with time delays

This repository contains a short implementation of an algorithm for determining the stability region of dynamical systems with multiple time delays. The algorithm solves the following question:

>_Consider a dynamical system whose characteristic function f(s) = s^2+2⋅ s ⋅ exp(-a⋅ s) + exp(-b⋅ s). For which values of parameters a and b is the system stable?_

Running the file as a script  plots the stability region of the given system.
